-- Dummy user functions file
-- ===========================

-- This file is loaded right after main actions.lua script loaded.
-- You can use this file to:
-- 1. Override any functions or settings in main script
-- 2. Execute any desired startup sequence for this aircraft (i.e. your own c&d state macro)
-- 3. ... use your imagination

-- This file will not be replaced on the aircraft module update, so all of your modifications
-- will remain active. Best practice from this moment is DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES in original
-- actions.lua file. Make all the modifications HERE.

-- insert your code below here:





-- Just a message in console
_log("[USER] User's modifications script is loaded...")
